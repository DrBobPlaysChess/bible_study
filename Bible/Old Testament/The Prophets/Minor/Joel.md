# Summary
## Chapter 1
	- In Joel's immediate past, God sent a devastating invasion of locusts to get the people's attention for disobeying Him. (violation of fulfilling God's commands)
	- The people knew the Locusts were from God's hand.  Look at [[Deuteronomy]] 28.  
## Chapter 2
	- The day of Lord is coming.  Refers to the tribulation, return of Christ, Judgement.
		- Describes the appearance of an army.  Joel is using similes to describe the future.  He says it's 'like' because he has no references to describe it exactly.
	- We need to get right with God.
- Uses similar language to [[Paul the Apostle]] in [[Bible/New Testament/Prophecy/Revelation]]
- The remedy for (Chapter 2:12-14) is: to get humble, be remorseful.  
- Whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Paul says this in the [[New Testament]]
- God is not measuring you against other people and does not grade on the curve.
- God looks at us and sees the same sinful nature.  He is the perfect example - the standard.
